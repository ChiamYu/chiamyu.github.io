A constant traveler at the intersection of engineering and science.


### Previous coding-related projects

**Code for optStoic and some pathway visualization scripts**: [repo](https://github.com/maranasgroup/optstoic-python)

**Visualizing strain design algorithm results using Escher-generated SVG metabolite map.** Hosted on Google App Engine: [link](http://optforceanalysis.appspot.com/index.html)
    - The website was made for sharing simulation results. The simulation + experimental results are published with an awesome team of scientists. [See paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2017.06.008)


**Grad school lab website:** [link](http://optforceanalysis.appspot.com/index.html)
    - This was created when I was learning the Bootstrap Framework. Currently, it is actively maintained by the lab members.
